# RESTful API for Date and Time. 

This API is written in `ruby` programming language and uses `parsi-date` gem to return value of time and date. You can use this API to find date in Persian (Jalali) and Gregorial calendars. 

## How it works?
It's simple, just run `api.rb` like this :

```bash
~$ ruby api.rb -p 4567
```
note that 4567 is default port of sinatra, but you can change it. Now, you can run `test.rb` and `test2.rb` to see how the API works.
